## About
This repo contains the data analylsis pipeline used to process the electrophysiological data obtained from recordings in mouse olfactory bulb slices. The project asks the question:
> **Do postnatal-born granule cells generated at different timepoints in the animal's life differ in their functional connectivity with primary excitatory cells in the olfactory bulb?**

Below is a brief overview of the analysis steps performed. Experimental results are not shown as the project is yet unpublished.

## Data collection
Electrophysiological recordings were obtained using custom-written software using [Igor 8](https://www.wavemetrics.com/)-based [MIES](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/MIES) from mitral cells (MC) and tufted cells (TC) in the olfactory bulb during optogenetic stimulation of olfactory granule cells (GC).

## Data analysis

### Identifying inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in MCs and TCs
The amplitude of excitatory currents recorded in TCs following optogenetic activation of OSNs were quantified.
